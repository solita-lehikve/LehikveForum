# Discussion Forum application and the used technologies.
This application shows the discussion topics and their messages.

Created this project to support my path to learn .net. I have selected following technologies for the project:
 - ASP.NET Core
   - No previous knowledge. As this will be a web-development project, the ASP.net is a good starting point.
 - MSSQL
   - Haven't done much of DB related work. I chose this as it is well known in .net community.
 - MVC pattern
   - Had the base knowledge from the Java side. Helps to manage complexity of the application.
 - Razor Pages
   - Microsoft Learn suggests this for the new developers. It is used to create dynamic web pages.
 - Entity Framework (ORM)
   - No previous knowledge. Introduces Code-First approach, making focus on domain of application.
 - Identity Core
   - No previous knowledge. Will be adding details after learning.
